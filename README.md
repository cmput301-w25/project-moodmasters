## Project Description

The Mood Masters app allows users to track their moods over time. Create Mood Events, follow other users, view maps & statistics, and more! Become a master of your moods!

## Key Features

- Track your moods: Users can create Mood Events to track their moods over time, storing information such as emotion, trigger, location, etc.
- Follow other users: Users can search for other users by username and request to follow them. If they are granted permission, they will be able to see the most recent Mood Events of their followed participants.
- Maps & statistics: Many options are provided for users to get an overview of the moods from both themselves and their followed participants. The maps display shows an accurate map of mood events based on their logged location, and the statistics display gives an overview of a user's past and recent mood events.
